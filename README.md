# Utility Scripts

This repo contains an assortment or various utility scripts.
I typically use them to automate semi-routine tasks.

**hevc_to_avc.bash [input_dir] [output_dir]**  
Converts mkv video files with HEVC encoding to mpg files with AVC encoding.
The file extensions (container) can likely be changed with some small modifications.
